The docker containers share the host network. As they run in locally the 
environment if the host's environment. In this implementation the services 
are containerized so that the services run independently and only communicate 
with each other. Their execution is not dependent on the environment or the 
other service. 

The host environment can access information about the containers that hold
each service. The key information shared is exposed ports, container ids and images
in additon to statuses. The host network hold uo the communication channel and 
allows a passage for the HTTP-communication between the services. 

Not so promenantly visibly the containers also provide their IP addresses and 
execution information to the host. The host supervises the network as a whole so 
it needs the location and availability information of the services.
